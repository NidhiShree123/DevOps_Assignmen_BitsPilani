# Declaration 
This repo contains the assignment details for the project work of subject - Introduction to DevOps. Every effort is made to indicate this clearly, with due reference to the literature, and acknowledgement of collaborative research and discussions.

# Contents 
1. Problem Statement
2. Methodology
3. Steps
   - Create a repository
   - Add Tow Directory and some raw code files to the repository
   -  Move Code from One directory to Another Directory
   -  Update one source code file and display the difference
   -  Create a Branch
   -  Add some raw code to the branch
   -  Merge the Branch with Main line
   -  Create the Jenkins pipeline, which is checking out the code and build and compiling it on every commit automatically.

4. Advantages of moving from Centralized Source Code to Distributed Version Control.

# Problem Statement 
ABC Organization would like to opt for the distributed version control system to upgrade their environment; where Git has been selected as the solution.
You been assigned as a consultant to educate the migration process to move their Source Code from Centralized to Distributed systems. As a phase one, you would like to go ahead with a workshop to demonstrate below operation to make the ABC team comfortable.

1. Create a Repository
2. Add Tow Directory and some raw code files to the repository
3. Move Code from One directory to Another Directory
4. Update one source code file and display the difference
5. Create a Branch
6. Add some raw code to the branch
7. Merge the Branch with Main line
And at the end provide the Summary of advantages of moving from Centralized Source Code to Distributed Version Control.

Part 2:
Create the Jenkins pipeline, which is checking out the code and build and compiling it on every commit automatically.

# Steps
1. Create Repository -
  - ## git init: used to initialise a new git repository within a directory
    
## Advantages of CVCs 
 - As each developer has their own copy of code, they can work offline. This is in contrast to having to constantly stay connected to the server, as in the case of centralized source code.

 - Faster and more efficient, because operations can be performed on local machines, and then later pushed / pulled to the version control server, when required.

 - Multiple levels of redundancy, because each developer would have a copy of the code on their system, even if the main server loses its copy, it can easily be recovered.

 - Much better branching support, where each new feature can have its own branch, which can be tested in isolation with each other and then later merged into the main branch once ready.
